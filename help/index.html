<header>Bloctweet Group Tweet Server</header>
<p>
Bloctweet is a simple server to facilitate groups who wish to tweet on a single account. It can
be used by companies, organizations, activists, and other groups to share a Twitter account
without sharing the password amongst the users. It has no fixed limits on number of contributors.
</p>
<p>
Bloctweet can be configured to received tweets via Direct Message, or via hashtags, or both. There
are separate refresh rates for each type of message. Twitter imposes limits on rate of queries
using the API, so proceed with caution if changing the refresh values. The values are in seconds.
