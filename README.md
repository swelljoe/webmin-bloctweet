webmin-bloctweet
================

Bloctweet Group Tweet Server configuration module. Bloctweet is a simple server, written by Corey Williams, to facilitate groups who wish to tweet on a single account. It can be used by companies, organizations, activists, and other groups to share a Twitter account without sharing the password amongst the users. It has no fixed limits on number of contributors.

This is a Webmin module to edit the configuration file for Bloctweet. It currently does not start, stop,
or otherwise manage the server but supports all editable configuraton options, including contributors.
